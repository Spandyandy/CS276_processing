Problem#1

1. How long (in seconds) would a sound file be that could map exactly to a 640 by 480 image?  In 640 x 480 image, there are 307,200 pixels. At 44.1 kHz, a sound file would take 6.966 seconds.

2. Give a possible image size that would result from mapping a 90 second sound file. At 44.1 kHz, there are 3,969,000 samples in 90 seconds. (44100*90) A possible image size would be the square root of 3,969,000 which is 1992 x 1992 pixels.

3. Is the sound recognizable when played back? Yes
